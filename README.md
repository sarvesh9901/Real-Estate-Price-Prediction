# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
**Problem Statement: Real Estate Price Prediction Website**

This comprehensive data science project series guides through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. The project involves using a Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com to construct a predictive model employing sklearn and linear regression. The three main components include:

1. **Model Building:**
   - Utilize sklearn and linear regression to build a predictive model for real estate prices.
   - Cover essential data science concepts: data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation.

2. **Python Flask Server:**
   - Develop a Python Flask server that utilizes the trained model to serve HTTP requests.
   - Establish a connection between the model and the website for seamless prediction retrieval.

3. **Website Development:**
   - Build a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Allow users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
   - Integrate the website with the Python Flask server to fetch and display predicted prices.

**Technologies and Tools:**
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDE
6. Python Flask for HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

**Outcome:**
By the end of this project, participants will have gained hands-on experience in data science concepts, model building, server development, and web development. The practical application of various technologies and tools provides a holistic understanding of real estate price prediction in a technology-driven context.
